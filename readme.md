= Grids.less

Borrowing heavily from the 960 grid system I wanted something similar but with some responsive-ness to it, along with some flexibility of overall width and possible changes to the gutters. Also having the grid in LESS allows for more semantic markup; free from the necessity of including styling directives in the markup.
